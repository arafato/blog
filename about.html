            <p>
	      Hi there! My name is Oliver Arafat and here’s my bio in a nutshell: Enterprise Evangelist at Amazon Web Services. Serious (ultra-)runner and cyclist, whenever I have the time. Husband to Cornelia, father of Lennie and Lilli.
	      </p>
<p>
	      I joined Amazon Web Services in April 2015 as an Enterprise Evangelist covering Germany. You can find some details of my activities on my <a href="https://de.linkedin.com/pub/oliver-arafat/21/30a/33">LinkedIn Profile</a> (along with a more complete version of my CV) so connect with me there if you’re interested in keeping up to date with what I’m up to.
</p>	      
	      Prior to joining AWS I spent over 3 years working for Microsoft as an enterprise consultant for cloud and web technologies where I helped customers in reaching their full potential with cloud-based solutions.

<p>
	      Even before that I was working for Siemens as a software architect and later on product manager for the first ever created embedded SOA middleware following the SCA standard.
