Hi there! My name is Oliver Arafat and here's my bio in a nutshell:
Enterprise Evangelist at Amazon Web Services. Serious (ultra-)runner
and cyclist, when I have the time. Husband to Cornelia, father of
Lennie and Lilli.

I joined Amazon Web Services in April 2015 as an Enterprise Evangelist
covering Germany. You can find some details of my activities on my
[LinkedIn Profile](https://de.linkedin.com/pub/oliver-arafat/21/30a/33)
(along with a more complete version of my CV) so connect with me there
if you're interested in keeping up to date with what I'm up to.

Prior to joining AWS I spent over 3 years working for Microsoft as an
enterprise consultant for cloud and web technologies where I helped
customers in reaching their full potential with cloud-based solutions.

Even before that I was working as a software architect and later on
product manager for the first ever created embedded SOA middleware
following the SCA standard.
